# Introduction

Difference between **compilers** and **interpreters** :

* Compilers accepts source program and generates target program.
* Interpreters accepts source program and input, generates output.


The phases of a compiler:

1. Lexical analysis. Also called scanning, convert character stream into meaningful sequences called *lexemes* (represented like \<token-name, attributes\>).
2. Syntax analysis. Also called parsing, creates a *syntax tree* inwhich each interior node represents an opration and the children represent the arguments of the operation.
3. Semantic analysis. Checks semantic consistency with the language definition, such as *type checking* .
4. Intermediate code generation. Generates *three-address code* , which consists no more than 3 operands and at most one operator on the right side.
5. Code optimization, attempts to improve the intermediate code so that better(faster) code will result.
6. Code generation, a crucial aspect of which is the judicious assignment of registers.

As for the history of programming language:

* 1st generation languages are machine languages.
* 2nd generation the assembly languages.
* 3rd generation like Fortran, Cobol, Lisp, C, C#
* 4th generation languages are designed for specific apps, like SQL, Postscript
* 5th generation language has been applied to logic- and constraint-based languages like Prolog and OPS5.

**environment** is mapping from names to locations in the store. **state** is a mapping from locations in store to their values. Both of them could be static or dynamic.

**Scopes** can be resolved staticly (within block structure) or dynamicly (virtual methods, etc.).

**Parameter passing** includes "call-by-value" and "call-by-reference". The latter caused aliasing problem.

> In the early programming language Algol 60, "call-by-name" mechanism is used. The formal parameters are substituted by actual parameters as if macros.

Two *forms of intermediate code* : (1) abstract syntax tree, and (2)sequence of three-address instructions.

**Context-free grammar** consists:

1. A set of terminal symbols.
2. A set of nonterminal symbols.
3. A set of productions (defined with Backus-Naur Form).
4. A designation of one of the nonterminals as the start symbol.

A **parse tree** is a tree with the following properties:

1. The root is labeled by the start symbol.
2. Each leaf is labeled by a terminal or $\epsilon$.
3. Each interior node is labeled by a nonterminal.
4. Each interior node A with children $X_1X_2 \cdots X_n$ represents a production $A \rightarrow X_1X_2 \cdots X_n$.

A grammar can have more than one parse tree for a given string of terminals. Such a grammar is said to be **ambiguous** .

Program fragments embedded within production bodies are called **symantic actions** .

$A \rightarrow A\alpha | \beta$ is said to be **left recursive** , because repeated application of this production builds up a sequence of $\alpha$s to the right of A, and lead to trees that grow down towars on the left. Similiarly, **right recursive** should be written as: $ R \rightarrow \alpha R | \epsilon$
